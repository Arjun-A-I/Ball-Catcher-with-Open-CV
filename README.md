# Ball-Catcher-with-Open-CV

This is a project aimed to explore the possibilities of object detection to real world scenarios. Here the goal is to catch a ball with the help of OpenCV-Arduino connectivity. The launched ball is caught with a box attached to a stepper railing set up.  
Language used are python (for OpenCV ) and Arduino C. The required libraries for python majorly are cvzone, pyserial, numpy.



ballcatcher.py contains the code to be executed for ball detection (pink color hsv is set).

ln289n.io contains the code to be uploaded to the arduino board.
