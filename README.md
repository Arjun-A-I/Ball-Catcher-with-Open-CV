# Ball-Catcher-with-Open-CV

This is a hardware based project where the objective is to catch a ball with a box attached to a railing. We wanted to achieve this without using any external sensors, thus using OpenCV-Arduino connectivity proved to be a good solution.


Language used here is python (for OpenCV ) and libraries needed are cvzone, pyserial, numpy.

ballcatcher.py contains the code to be executed for ball detection (pink color hsv is set).
ln289n.io contains the code to be uploaded to the arduino board.
