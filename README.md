# Ball-Catcher-with-Open-CV

This is a hardware based project where the objective is to catch a ball with a box attached to a railing. We wanted to achieve this without using any external sensors, thus using OpenCV-Arduino connectivity proved to be a good solution.


Language used here is python (for OpenCV ) and libraries needed are cvzone, pyserial, numpy.
